# Workshops

AZFO Workshops offer an opportunity to improve your birding field skills.

We have hosted these workshops in an indoor setting, out in the field, or by Zoom.

## Shorebird Workshop

We held our shorebird ID workshop on August 26th, at Lake Cochise in Wilcox. Many thanks to the 16 participants and to our three knowledgeable leaders...and to the 1944 shorebirds (19 species) counted. The group tallied a total of 67 bird species - outstanding!
