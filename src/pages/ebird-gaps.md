# Arizona eBird Gaps

## Help us fill in the gaps in our knowledge of Arizona birds

Welcome to the AZFO eBird Gaps project! Arizona Field Ornithologists (AZFO) is a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing the knowledge of Arizona's birds. One of our main focuses has always been exploring areas of Arizona where we lack the full picture of the status and distribution birds. This project introduces a new way for birders to take part in this venture, by contributing their sightings to the global citizen science database, eBird.

Through the year, we will feature maps of different areas of the state lacking eBird data and will provide information on how to access these areas. This will include locations lacking data for particular seasons or months of the year, and highlight species that may occur there that haven't been found yet. Please see the sections below for information on how to participate and tips for preparing before going into the field.

Help us fill in the gaps in our knowledge of Arizonaâ€™s birds! To get a sense of the current eBird coverage in the state, check out this map (pdf) showing the current eBird points (through April 2020).
