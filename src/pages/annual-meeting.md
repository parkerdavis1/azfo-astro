# Annual Meetings

## Meet Your Fellow Birders at our Annual Meetings

Every year, usually in the autumn, AZFO hosts a 2-or 3-day annual gathering. It is the one chance for birders from around the entire state (and further afield) to get together with old friends, to get to know other like-minded folks, and to simply celebrate what we are all about - the birds of Arizona.

These gatherings offer field expeditions, a day of scientific reports, birding quizzes, a banquet with a speaker, and social time.

## 2024 Annual Meeting September 26-29

## AZFO Achievement Award

The AZFO Achievement Award recognizes those who have made a significant contribution to Arizona's ornithological knowledge, and/or promoted the value of birds, both aesthetic and economic. We recognize award winners at the annual meeting banquets. Know a deserving candidate? [Submit a nomination](#).
