In July of this year (2023), we led a Field Expedition to look for Green Kingfisher in a 6-mile stretch of the Santa Cruz river that is not yet fully open to the public. Despite the heat, our teams found 14 Green Kingfishers in this new, sensitive stretch of the river! Our survey results will guide river managers as they work to protect that section of the river.
