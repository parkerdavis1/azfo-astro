Join AZFO on Saturday, April 20th and Sunday, April 21st for the Avra Valley Field Expedition.

This is a unique opportunity to explore this scenic Upper Sonoran desert valley west of Tucson. The valley's xeric thorn woodlands, consisting of Ironwood, Palo Verde, and Acacia within washes, make it a unique and fascinating place to visit.

You can expect to find a variety of species such as Gilded Flickers, Gila and Ladder-backed Woodpeckers, Bendire's Thrashers, Verdins, Black-throated Sparrows, Cactus Wrens, and Elf Owls. The expedition is scheduled during peak migration, with the possibility of spotting some unexpected species. Don't miss this chance to explore the secrets of Avra Valley with us!

We will conduct surveys in the northwest region of the Silverbell mountain range to collect quality data for species present and breeding activity.

This is a great opportunity to learn and gain experience, enjoy the outdoors, and bird with other like-minded conservation enthusiasts.
