Diana has been enjoying birds and many other aspects of natural history for all of her adult life. In the past she shared her appreciation of and knowledge about birds by leading birdwalks for the San Diego Natural History Museum in Balboa Park in San Diego, California, for the Nature Conservancy at their Hart Prairie Preserve near Flagstaff, Arizona, and for the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona. Currently she is active in the Arizona Field Ornithologists and enthusiastically supports that organization's research, education, and outreach programs. She has done some travel to see birds in other parts of the country and the world, but now she is concentrating on enjoying more of the rich birdlife of Arizona.
