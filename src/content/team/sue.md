Sue enjoyed a career as a CPA until she simply had to retire when tax season kept interfering with spring migration season. For 40 years, Sue has been involved with Audubon chapters in the West, with HawkWatch International, and now with AZFO. Birds bring meaning to Sue's world, and she tries to pass it forward.
