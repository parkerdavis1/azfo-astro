Jelena has always loved the outdoors, but her affinity for birds slowly started after she saw a magical Black-Crowned Night Heron hanging out by a pond. Her "bird-thusiasm" flourished when she moved to Arizona in 2022. She spends her free time volunteering for AZFO and Audubon, birding, exploring, and learning as much as she can. Jelena works as a Biologist for a consulting firm, and is always looking for that next field survey opportunity.
