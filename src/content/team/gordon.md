Gordon made his way to Arizona and its plethora of avian subjects via Nebraska. He was quick to become involved in Arizonaâ€™s wonderful birds. He has participated in many Christmas Bird Counts, along with the annual Greater Phoenix Waterbird Count. He has also volunteered to lead bird walks for Maricopa Audubon and Tucson Audubon, including trips to Sonora, Mexico. He has also participated in several AZFO field trips in the past. Recently, he led a short bird walk for Birdlife International at a conference that was held at a resort in Scottsdale. And he's no slouch with a camera, either!
