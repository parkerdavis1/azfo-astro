Dara started birding in 2017, becoming immersed in the AZ birding community. She is passionate about birding with a purpose, from youth education, to surveying birds for conservation efforts, to assisting AZFO's efforts in gaining a better understanding of bird distribution in regions lacking data. She has an affinity for AZ's underexplored and underbirded wilderness areas, and she goes into the backcountry any chance she gets.
