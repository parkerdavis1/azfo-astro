In both his personal and professional life, Steve works to engage people in conservation action. Through bird survey, advocacy, hands-on habitat work, partnerships, and guided experiences in nature, he has been committed to building a birding community that is inclusive and welcoming and that puts conservation first. As a science communicator and experienced field biologist, he hopes to use his time as an AZFO board member to further the science needed to most effectively conserve Arizona’s wild bird populations, with enphasis on historically under-represented birds and locations.

Steve earned a Bachelor's of Science in Conservation Biology and Ecological Sustainability from Arizona State University and spends his days on the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch of the National Audubon Society where he serves as the sanctuary’s Director. When he's not looking up to find birds, he's looking down to find snakes.
