Tice was a Hawk Mountain hawk watcher in her youth. Her best field expeditions were two Grand Canyon rafting trips surveying for Peregrine Falcons. Tice has an affinity for the under appreciated “brown birds”, Abert’s Towhee, thrashers, grassland sparrows, and such. She is championing the Audubon Community Science Pinyon Jay project and she is keenly interested in the Arizona Motus network.
